# roguelike-js
An open world roguelike game powered by ROT.js for nostalgia hungry desktop gamers. Includes a stripped basic version of html5 boilerplate.

A project for learning more about game development, JavaScript (although not ES2015), collaboration and kindling some roguelike passion.


TODO: ROT.js tests, webpack/npm integration, finish basic tutorial.
